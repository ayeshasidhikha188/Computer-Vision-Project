**Preprocess Images:** Convert raw images into a pandas DataFrame.
**Annotate:** Classify images into 26 alphabet classes.
**Develop Model:** Create a robust machine learning model for character recognition.
**Deployment:** Ensure low latency and lightweight performance.

## Dataset
**Total Files:** 372,451
**File Type:** .png
**Mode:** Grayscale ('L')
**Image Size:** (28, 28) pixels
#### Logistic Regression Model Performance
**Accuracy: 85.54%**
**Training Time: 32.6 seconds (0.5433 minutes)**
**Prediction Time: 0.0781 seconds (0.0013 minutes)**

## Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model demonstrates effective performance in recognizing handwritten characters. Future enhancements could involve exploring deep learning techniques for improved accuracy and real-time processing capabilities.
